The first order interneurons L1,L2 and L3 in the medulla invert the sign of the photoreceptor input and all depolarize to OFF and hyperpolarize to ON. Then, these L neurons pass their signals to medulla neurons which become selective and depolarize either to ON or to OFF.\n",

    "T4 cells project their dendrites in the proximal medulla and their axon terminals in the lobula plate, where they end up in four different layers that respond to four different directions of motions for a given z-depth, having in totall 6 different cell populations covering 6 different directions of motion. These differential axonal projection into four different layers has allowed to subdivide T4 cells in four subtypes: T4a, T4b, T4c and T4d.\n",

    "In graph theory and network analysis, indicators of centrality assign numbers or rankings to nodes within a graph corresponding to their network position. Applications include identifying the most influential person(s) in a social network, key infrastructure nodes in the Internet or urban networks, super-spreaders of disease, and brain networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic measurements of centrality include:\n",
    "1. **Degree centrality**: is defined as the number of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has). The degree can be interpreted in terms of the immediate risk of a node for catching whatever is flowing through the network (such as a virus, or some information). In the case of a directed network (where ties have direction), we usually define two separate measures of degree centrality, namely indegree and outdegree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvector centrality**: Also known as eigencentrality. It is a measure of the influence of a node in a network. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Closeness centrality**: the normalized closeness centrality (or closeness) of a node is the average length of the shortest path between the node and all other nodes in the graph. Thus the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes. Taking distances from or to all other nodes is irrelevant in undirected graphs, whereas it can produce totally different results in directed graphs (e.g. a website can have a high closeness centrality from outgoing link, but low closeness centrality from incoming links).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Betweeness centrality**: Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. It was introduced as a measure for quantifying the control of a human on the communication between other humans in a social network by Linton Freeman.[26] In his conception, vertices that have a high probability to occur on a randomly chosen shortest path between two randomly chosen vertices have a high betweenness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node degree and eignencentrality assume that just the existance of a connection betweem nodees (bynary rule), is what matters, not considering the actual distance in the connections. For closeness and betweenss centrality, the distances matter, since they involve shortest path calculations.\n",
